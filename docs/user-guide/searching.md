# Searching Messages

Master the platform's powerful search and filtering capabilities to find the intelligence you need.

## Overview

The platform offers two complementary search interfaces:

1. **Browse Messages** (`/`) - Filter-first approach with live updates
2. **Unified Search** (`/search`) - Search-first approach across all content types

## Browse Messages Interface

### Search Bar

Located at the top of the Browse Messages page, the search bar supports:

**Full-Text Search**
```
Search across original content and translations
Examples:
- "T-90 tank destroyed"
- "Avdiivka offensive"
- "HIMARS strike"
```

**Semantic Search** (AI-Powered)
- Toggle "Use Semantic Search" checkbox
- Finds messages by meaning, not just keywords
- Example: "military vehicle damage" finds mentions of tanks, APCs, artillery

```
Regular search:  "tank" → finds only "tank"
Semantic search: "tank" → finds "T-90", "armored vehicle", "BMP", "BTR"
```

### Country Filter

Prominent quick filter for channel groups:

- **All Channels** - No filtering (default)
- **Ukrainian Channels** - Only channels in `Archive-UA` and `Monitor-UA` folders
- **Russian Channels** - Only channels in `Archive-RU` and `Monitor-RU` folders

Selecting a country filter automatically clears individual channel selection.

### Search Performance

Search timing displayed in top-right:
```
250ms - Fast text search
1500ms - Semantic search (normal)
```

## Advanced Search Techniques

### Boolean Operators

Full-text search supports PostgreSQL operators:

```
tank & destroyed     → Both words must appear
tank | vehicle       → Either word
tank & !russian      → "tank" but not "russian"
"exact phrase"       → Phrase matching
```

### Semantic Search Tips

**Good semantic queries:**
- Concepts: "military casualties"
- Descriptions: "damaged armored vehicles"
- Situations: "urban combat footage"

**Less effective:**
- Single words: "tank" (use text search)
- Proper nouns: "Bakhmut" (use text search)
- Exact quotes: Use text search instead

### Combining Filters

**Find viral combat footage:**
```
Topic: Combat
Media Type: Video
Min Views: 5000
Sort: Views descending
```

**Monitor high-priority Ukrainian sources:**
```
Country: Ukraine
Importance: High
Date: Last 24 Hours
Sort: Date descending
```

**Research specific equipment:**
```
Search: "T-90M"
Topic: Equipment
Media Type: Photo
Sort: Date descending
```

## Saving Searches as RSS Feeds

Once you've configured your search and filters, subscribe to updates:

1. Configure all desired filters
2. Click "Subscribe Feed" button
3. Choose format:
   - **RSS 2.0** - Most compatible (Feedly, Inoreader)
   - **Atom 1.0** - Better content structure
   - **JSON Feed** - For developers/APIs
4. Copy URL to clipboard
5. Add to your feed reader

See [RSS Feeds](rss-feeds.md) for detailed feed management.

## Pagination

Browse messages with pagination controls at the bottom:

- **Items per page**: 20, 50, 100
- **Navigation**: Previous, Next, Jump to page
- **Total count**: Shows filtered results count

## Performance Tips

### Fast Searches
- Use text search for specific terms
- Filter by channel first (reduces dataset)
- Use date ranges to limit scope

### Comprehensive Searches
- Use semantic search for concepts
- Allow more time for AI processing
- Consider RSS feeds for ongoing monitoring

### Large Result Sets
- Apply topic filter to narrow scope
- Use importance filter to prioritize
- Increase items per page to reduce clicks

## Troubleshooting

### No Results Found

**Check your filters:**
- Clear all filters and try again
- Verify date range isn't too narrow
- Try different search terms

**Semantic search limitations:**
- Requires messages to have embeddings
- Not all old messages are embedded
- Try text search as fallback

### Search Too Slow

**Optimize your query:**
- Reduce date range
- Filter by channel first
- Use text search instead of semantic
- Avoid wildcard searches

### Unexpected Results

**Understand content matching:**
- Searches both original AND translated text
- Semantic mode finds related concepts
- Check "Active Filters" summary

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Enter` in search box → Perform search
- `Esc` → Clear search focus
- Page controls work with keyboard navigation
