# Standalone MkDocs for docs repo development
# Use this when working on docs independently from the main platform
#
# For integrated development, use the main platform's docker-compose instead:
#   cd ../osint-intelligence-platform
#   docker-compose --profile dev up mkdocs
#
# Port 8002 is used here to avoid conflict with main platform's mkdocs (8001)
